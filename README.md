# Dicee SwiftUI Project With MVVM

![Dicee Screen Shot](DiceeSS.png)

## Overview
Dicee is a simple dice-rolling app built with SwiftUI. It allows users to simulate the rolling of two six-sided dice.

## Features
- Tap the "Roll" button to randomly roll two dice.
- Each die face is represented by a high-quality image.
- The interface is designed to be simple and intuitive.

## MVVM Architecture
This project follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern to ensure a clean separation of concerns and improve maintainability.

### Model
Represents the data and business logic of the app. In this case, it's the representation of a dice and its possible states.

### View
Contains the UI components. Views observe the ViewModel and update themselves when the ViewModel's state changes.

### ViewModel
Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It handles the app's logic and updates the View with new data.
